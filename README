//////////////// IMPORTANT FILES ////////////////////

Please see the "Joint_dir" folder for our finalized work.

image_manip.c contains the image manipulation functions (blur, rotate, grayscale, saturate, blend, pointilism).

project.c contains the main() function and supports use of the tools.

//////////////// PROJECT OVERVIEW /////////////////////

The project uses the C programming language.

This project support a tool capable of editing images in six ways: Blur, rotate, grayscale, saturate, blend, and pointilism.
The user supplies an image file in ppm format. 

Blur() applies a Gaussian convolution, and is the most complex of 
all the functions. 

Saturate() allows the user to choose a degree by which to intensify or dampen the color in the image.

Blend() overlays two images where they overlap, with the user able to specify the emphasis on each image in the overlap.

Grayscale() is analogous to saturate, but with input value of zero, i.e. no color (full dampening).

Pointilism applies the artistic effect of the same name based on random number generation, interspersing the image with black
dots of randomized size.

Rotate() rotates the image by 90 degrees counterclockwise. Multiple rotations allow rotations 180 and 270 degrees counterclockwise.
